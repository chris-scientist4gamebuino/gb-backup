[Back to Home](./../../../README.MD) | [Go to Classic Reference Summary](./../reference/README.MD)

## Examples

The Gamebuino library includes several examples for you to understand how to make games. They are heavily commented so you can understand what each line does. If you never ever programmed though, you should read the [Foundation article](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations) from Arduino.

You should start to go through the basic examples first, and if you have any doubt about what a function does you'll find it in the Gamebuino Classic [Reference](./../reference/README.MD) for Gamebuino specific stuff, or in the [Arduino Reference](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage) for general C++/microcontroller things like conditional loops or data types.

Once you have installed the library (following the [Getting started](./getting-started.md) guide), you can open the examples directly from the Arduino software in File/Examples/Gamebuino. You can also find them on [Gamebuino's GitHub](https://github.com/Gamebuino/Gamebuino-Classic) in /libraries/Gamebuino/examples.

By following the link below you will find information about [sound management on Gamebuino Classic](./sound.md).

## Emulators

You don't even need a Gamebuino to start developing games, you can use one of the [Emulators](./../other/emulators.md)!

## Optimization

- [Memory optimization](./memory-optimization.md) details tips and tricks for tracking memory usage in your Gamebuino applications.
- [Performance optimization](./performance-optimization.md) is a list of general ideas and tips & tricks as well to make your code run faster.

## Tech Demos

Samples that may or may not use the official library but are designed to demonstrate the hardware's capabilities.

- [SD card audio streaming](./sd-card-audio-streaming.md) : convert and play any audio file out the Gamebuino speaker!
- [Grey-scale rendering](./grey-scale-rendering.md) : demo showing how to display 3 colors on the LCD: black, white and grey.
- [3D dungeon rendering](./3d-dungeon-rendering.md) : simple 3D rendering demo in the vein of Wolfenstein 3D.
